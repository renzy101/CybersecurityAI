[AG NEWS-BERT-CLARE-Text Attack](https://github.com/renzy101/CybersecurityAI/blob/main/AG_News_CLARE_NLP_TextAttack_final.ipynb) and [QNLI-BERT-CLARE-Text Attack](https://github.com/renzy101/CybersecurityAI/blob/main/QNLI_CLARE_NLP_TextAttack_final.ipynb) files are my reproduction of the experiments in the paper using text attack since the environment provided by the researchers were broken. They were exexuted using Google Colab Pro

[ROTTEN TOMATOES-ALBERT-CLARE-Text Attack](https://github.com/renzy101/CybersecurityAI/blob/main/RottenTomatoes_CLARE_NLP_TextAttack_final.ipynb) file is my replication of the experiment. I attempted to use CLARE on a smaller dataset and different MLP Model (ALBERT) to see if I could improve the results. I played with the Clare Augmentater in TextAttack as well.
